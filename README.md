# Matrix RSS MQTT version

This is a matrix led display that shows time, temperature, and latest news.

Temperature and news items are obtained from  MQTT.

I am using Feedreader plugin with homneassistant and an automation that publishes the title to mqtt (follow the example [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/feedreader/). Another branch has a build in news reader.
